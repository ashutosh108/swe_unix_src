# swe_unix_src
Copy of source code for Swiss Ephemeris astronomy calculations library. The intention is to be able to use this repository as a git submodule in other projects.

All copyright of this project is by http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephinfo_e.htm. Distributed here under GPLv2 license.

As of now (July 2018) it is a copy from http://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/swe_unix_src_2.07.01.tar.gz EXCEPT two files I have omitted:
- src/PerlSwissEph-2.07.tar.gz (large Perl module including precompiled binaries)
- src/swetest (presumably forgotten compiled test file)
